This is a school assessment project in my first semester of my part-time master degree. 
The dataset is downloaded from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rikdifos/credit-card-approval-prediction

The objective of this project is to demonstrate applying some ML models to solve to task which is:
"
Build a machine learning model to predict if an applicant is 'good' or 'bad' client, different from other tasks, the definition of 'good' or 'bad' is not given. 
You should use some techique, such as vintage analysis to construct you label. Also, unbalance data problem is a big problem in this task.
"
